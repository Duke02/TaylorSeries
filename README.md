A Taylor Series implemenation using Python, SymPy, and NumPy

### Special Thanks
Thank you to Mic over [here](http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/03/taylor-series-with-python-and-sympy.html) for his blog post that really helped me get set up. I really just took his code and added error bounding honestly in order to find an approximation that is less than a given error.
